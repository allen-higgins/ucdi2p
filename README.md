This project is a template for students own working areas for class I teach titled **Introduction to Programming**.\
The file `my-attendance.csv` is for tracking your attendance in both lectures and tutorials over the 12 weeks of term.\
Two subfolders, `group-project` and `sandbox`, are the place for your working copies of files like python code and related materials. Use `group-project` for the group project, and `sandbox` for experiments and learning exercises.\
Do please create new `folders` and `files` as you experiment and learn!\
