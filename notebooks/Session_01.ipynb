After installing VS Code we recommend you run VS Code using the launcher from Anaconda-Navigator. You may need to install the official Python extension from Microsoft and other Extensions from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.\n",

    "    1. Create a new file in VS Code named `session1.py`.\n",
    "    2. Type `print(\"Hello from VS Code!\")` in the file.\n",
    "    3. Save the file and run it from the VS Code terminal by typing `python session1.py`. Note that you many need to provide the path to python and the path to your saved file. Have a look at the TERMINAL tab in VS Code when you select the **Play** button aka `Run Python File` or from the menu `Run>Run Without Debugging ^F5`.\n",
    "- [ ] **Create a GitHub Account:** Sign up for a free account using your UCD Connect email address at [GitHub.com](https://github.com).\n",
