Functions are the solution. A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n","\n","In finance, you can create functions for common calculations like:\n","- Calculating financial ratios (P/E, Sharpe Ratio)\n","- Valuing an asset using a specific model (like the Dividend Discount Model)\n","- Calculating loan payments\n","\n","This makes your code cleaner, easier to debug, and much more efficient."],"id":"69NjsGTrwvGu"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2q3OBMy6wvGv"},"source":["## 1.

The code that the function will execute is indented below the definition.\n","\n","- **Parameters:** Variables listed inside the parentheses are **parameters**. They are the inputs the function needs to do its job.\n","- **`return` statement:** The `return` keyword is used to send a value back from the function."],"id":"2q3OBMy6wvGv"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6omn9Vy_wvGv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756755378363,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Allen Higgins","userId":"03709571796361164306"}},"outputId":"734ee974-4958-4b58-9873-6094bb1959e8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Company A's Profit Margin: 5.88%\n","Company B's Profit Margin: 20.00%\n"]}],"source":["# Let's define a function to calculate net profit margin\n","# It needs two parameters: net_income and revenue\n","\n","def calculate_profit_margin(net_income, revenue):\n","    \"\"\"Calculates the net profit margin given net income and revenue.\"\"\"\n","    if revenue == 0:\n","        return 0 # Avoid division by zero\n","\n","    margin = (net_income / revenue) * 100\n","    return margin\n","\n","# Now, let's CALL the function with some data\n","company_a_income = 50000000 # 50 Million\n","company_a_revenue = 850000000 # 850 Million\n","\n","profit_margin_a = calculate_profit_margin(company_a_income, company_a_revenue)\n","\n","# The value returned by the function is stored in our 'profit_margin_a' variable\n","print(f\"Company A's Profit Margin: {profit_margin_a:.2f}%\")\n","\n","# We can reuse it easily for another company\n","profit_margin_b = calculate_profit_margin(net_income=200, revenue=1000)\n","print(f\"Company B's Profit Margin: {profit_margin_b:.2f}%\")"],"id":"6omn9Vy_wvGv"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3agF72hmwvGv"},"source":["### Docstrings\n","The string right after the function definition (`\"\"\"...\"\"\"`) is called a **docstring**.
